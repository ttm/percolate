Percolate your social systems
==================================================================

Percolation unites Gmane, Participation, Social and MASS packages to enable anthropological physics experiments and social harnessing. Core features are:  

    - Ease percolation in social systems by processes such as collection and diffusion of information.

    - Enable knowledge about the networked self.

    - Make abstract animations from social data.                      

    - Make music from social data to fit animation as soundtrack.

    - Verification of expected stability and differentiation on the social structures.

    - Directions for agents and networks typologies, extending features from Gmane package.

    - Integration of resources through RDF data and OWL ontologies.  

    - Routines for representing data from social networks (tweets, Facebook data, IRC logs, LinkedIn, Gmane lists) as RDF.

    - Cross provenance resource recommendation, extending facilities from the Participation package.

    - Generation of activity reports.                                 


Usage example
=================

.. code:: python

    import percolation as P

    # Use participation, social, gmane and mass
    # to explore your social systems.

    # more ***under construction***
    # Enjoy!
